Contributions are greatly appreciated.  Somehow let me know that you are interested, and we will go from there.  `TODO.md` lists many outstanding tasks.

At the moment all forms of issue ticket are accepted, though please attach a log file and the party files when reporting a bug.  You may want to look at `TODO.md` before reporting a bug, as many known issues are listed there already.

I will also look at any pull request submitted.

Simple enough?  Thank you for your interest!
