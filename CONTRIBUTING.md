Thank you for your interest in contributing to this software!  Below are some brief guidelines on how you can contribute, in order of increasing level of commitment.

# Issue Tickets

At the moment all forms of issue ticket are accepted, though please attach a log file and the party files when reporting a bug.  You may want to look at `TODO.md` before reporting a bug, as many known issues are listed there already.

# Pull Requests

I will look at any pull request submitted.  This may be more efficient than an Issue Ticket if you notice a minor problem with documentation.

# Code Contributions

Contributions are greatly appreciated!  Somehow let me know that you are interested, and we will go from there.  `TODO.md` lists many outstanding tasks.

Some potential projects:

* Develop an SQLite backend for characters
* Develop a GUI frontend, presumably in Python, to
  - Manage deferred movement or action queues
  - Facilitate input of character details


Simple enough?  Thank you for your interest!
