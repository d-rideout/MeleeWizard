* find parties in `parties/`
* use extensions for party files?
  Maybe not for starters.
* find parties in spite of extensions

* put in reactions to injury or have them put it into adj dx!
  note injury will change execution order!!

* Implement deferred actions (4apr021)
* Provide party template for github (4apr021)

* Handle death / unconsciousness
* Allow referencing characters by first letters of name

* GPL wants a blurb at the opening of the program
* Should I rename the file to something better, without the .pl extension?

  Learn md again?
  Figure out who holds copyright etc!  Metagaming I think.
* Start with surprise turn 0?
* initiative should be by player not character?  That is how it works in the
  usual rules.
